This full-stack app manages contacts via a user-friendly interface.  The Spring Boot backend uses Web, DevTools, Lombok, JPA, and PostgreSQL for API creation, rapid development, reduced boilerplate, simplified database interaction, and data persistence.  It exposes REST endpoints for CRUD operations and photo management.  The React frontend offers a dynamic experience for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting contacts, potentially including image uploads and pagination. Axios connects frontend and backend, handling JSON data exchange. The three-tier architecture (React, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL) ensures maintainability and scalability.
